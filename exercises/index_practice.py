"""This is a practice question for using indices with str values."""

# This program tells you which index a specific character appears in for a specific word!

txt = "Hello, world. "
x = txt.index("e")
print(x)

"""end test"""

# It will print "1," since "e" appears in index 1 of the txt variable.
