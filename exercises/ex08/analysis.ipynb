While I was worried that not all students were satasfied with the content of the course or wanted a more diverse introduction. From my analysis, I found that a great majority of students were interested in their work and an even greater majority saw the value and relavance in the material they are working with. \n",

From this visualization I wanted to get a rundown of all the results so I utilized the `count` fuction we utilized in the last exercise. This was well informing, however, I then went further and wrote an `average` fuction to find the average level of interest and importance in the curriculum (which were valued on a scale from 1-7).\n",

    "I wish I could have utilized more variables in this analysis or cleaned the data to remove existing holes for several of the questions. I think my Idea to create more choice in the curriculum is reasonable but the costs of the UTAs and graders in terms of time commitment could be astronomicale. Further, students who choose to continue computer science should be equally prepared for the following classes. I think alternitively, the class could push more opportunities to use comp outside of the classroom and possibly incentivise students with extra credit. In teh future I would like to explore the difficulty of the class for students who are majors vs non majors. There is lots of data to analyse this prompt and it could improve the lives of future students taking the course.\n"
